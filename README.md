# Password-Visibility

Week 1 - Monday

Project: Toggle Password Visibility
For your first project, you’re going to write a script that let’s users toggle the visibility of a password field.

I’ve put together a template to help you get started, available at the Source Code link below as a single HTML document. Add your code down in the footer.

The template includes some basic form styles so you can focus on the JavaScript.

The Template
When a user clicks the #show-password checkbox, the #password field should display the password in plain text if the box is checked, or mask it if it’s not.

Feel free to change the markup if needed or desired.
